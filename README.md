Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Implementation

Overview

This project implements Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection in data transmission. CRC is used to detect accidental changes to raw data in digital networks and storage devices. The algorithm computes a checksum (remainder) based on the division of the data by a fixed binary divisor (the polynomial).

This implementation is written in [Programming Language] and supports customizable CRC polynomial and initial values.

Features

Compute CRC for a given data string.

Supports user-defined generator polynomial.

Option to define initial value for CRC calculation.

Verification of data integrity through CRC check.


Algorithm

1. Input Data: The binary data string to be transmitted.


2. Divisor (Polynomial): A predefined binary number used for division.


3. CRC Calculation: Perform polynomial division and append the remainder to the original data to form the CRC code.


4. Verification: The received data (data + CRC) is checked using the same polynomial to verify integrity.
